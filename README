This is a template for creating a presentation with the \LaTeX package
BEAMER.  It includes a color theme that uses the Virginia Tech web palette.

HISTORY
  * Nov 2010 - original version by Phil Benchoff (benchoff@bev.net).

LIMITATIONS/CAVEATS

* If a PNG image is included, most versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader will
  display the whole presentation with the wrong gamma.  Because of this,
  the included logs is a JPG with a background that matches the
  presentation.  If you use a different background color, you will have
  to add it.  There is a .xcf file you can add a background to with GIMP.
  You may be able to use another PDF reader to avoid the problem as well.
  (This problem occurs with a PNG logo anyway.  It may not be all PNG
  images.)

* This presentation was developed with the BEAMER theme Antibes.  It
  is not known how well the color palette will work with other themes.

* Work on the handout, notes, and article versions is not complete
  yet.

QUICK START

  Assuming you have all the LaTeX components necessary to use BEAMER,
  just type "make" to create the presentation slides.  "make all" will
  also create the other document types.
